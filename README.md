# Resource Extraction & Salvage (RES) System
1. Break down props for materials
2. Use tools and machines to extract resources from the world
3. Craft stuff with your resources

## Basic progression
0. Multitool
1. Workstation, Storage Cabinets
2. Burners, Drills, Smelter
3. Pumpjack, Refinery, Generator
4. Foundry, Autolathe

## Tools
One multitool SWEP with different modes.

### Wrench
- Salvage props

### E-Tool
- Plant saplings on dirt
- Chop grown trees (not trees in the world!)
- Dig up detritus
- Quickly break down wooden props

### Hammer
- Place down blueprints
- Construct blueprints
- Repair buildings

## Buildings
Power is automatically taken from nearby generators and can be turned into a resource.

### Storage Cabinet
Stores resources.

### Workstation
General purpose assembly station for non-building stuff
Can make parts, but takes some time and requires player

### Burner
Create power from wood or coal

### Generator
Create power from fuel

### Drill
Place on a site to get coal or ore. If there's no deposit, mines detritus.
Has internal power and resource storage, but can only be manually operated.
Can be undeployed and moved around with gravgun

### Pumpjack
Static building that drills for oil.

### Smelter
Consume power to smelt raw resources
- Ore -> Metal
- Scrap -> Metal
- Oil -> Polymer
- Wood -> Coal
- Detritus -> Glass

### Refinery
Consume power to refine raw resources
- Ore -> Chemicals
- Oil -> Fuel
- Detritus -> Cement

### Foundry
Consume power to create refined metal and polymer

### Autolathe
Consume power to assemble parts quickly and automatically

## Resource Types
### Crude
- Wood
  - Get from wooden props or growing saplings
  - Turn into coal or crude parts
- Scrap
  - Get from metal props
  - Turn into metal or crude parts
- Oil
  - Get from barrel props or pumpjack
  - Turn into fuel or polymer
- Detritus (sand/gravel)
  - Dig using E-Tool
  - Turn into glass or cement
- Ore
  - Get from deployable drill
  - Turn into metal or chemicals

### Reclaimed
- Coal
  - Get from drill or smelting wood
- Metal
  - Get from smelting scrap or ore
- Fuel
  - Get from fuel props or refining oil
- Glass
  - Get from glass props or smelting detritus
- Polymer
  - Get from plastic/rubber props or refining oil
- Cement
  - Get from refining detritus
  - Just a building material

### Refined
- Refined Metal
  - metal + coal
- Refined Polymer
  - polymer + fuel

### Parts
- Crude Parts
  - Assemble from Scrap + Wood
- Industrial Parts
  - Assemble from Metal + Polymer
- Advanced Parts
  - Assemble from R. Metal + R. Polymer + Glass# RES
